### Overview
This Python for beginners training course leads the students from the basics of writing and running Python scripts to more advanced features such as file operations, working with binary data, and using the extensive functionality of Python modules. Extra emphasis is placed on features unique to Python, such as tuples, array slices, and output formatting.

### Prerequisites
Students should already be comfortable using the operating system (Linux, Unix, Windows, Solaris, Mac OS X, etc.) on which they will be running Python. While not mandatory, basic skills with at least one other programming language are desirable.
### Materials
